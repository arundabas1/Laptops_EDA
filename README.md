# ðŸ’» Laptop Market EDA

This project explores a real-world laptop dataset to uncover trends in pricing, specifications, and screen types. The primary goal was to strengthen my SQL skills through hands-on analysis.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset Source
- Kaggle

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Most laptops with UHD screens are priced significantly higher than those with HD or FHD.
- Gaming laptops tend to have larger screens and dual storage setups (SSD + HDD).
- Lenovo dominates the gaming segment with high RAM and hybrid storage configurations.
- Screen resolution strongly correlates with price in data.



## ðŸš€ How to Reproduce
1. Import `raw_laptop_data.csv` into MySQL Workbench.
2. Run `laptops_creation.sql` to create the schema.
3. Execute queries from `eda_queries.sql` to explore and clean the data.
4. Export the final result as `cleaned_laptop_data.csv`.
